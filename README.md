## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🧙 Almanax Bot
Sends daily Almanax updates from the Dofus universe to Discord servers, fully automated using an api to ensure the information. (not online)

### 📚 E-Pad
A custom retro-styled terminal built for Linux, windows and mac. Plays MP3s, and features a minimal UI designed for retro environments (downloadable app)

### 🔍 Pokédex Web App
A full Pokédex frontend with scrollable index and dedicated Pokémon pages. Built using modern JS and a custom backend with relational data. (not online)

### 🪪 Portfolio
It updates automatically so i dont have to add every github project on it manually. It is on a private repository and that voluntary.

### 📜 Electronjs-template
Everything is in the name, this is a template for the ones starting with electron. I created this templace to see how a template works too so it may not be perfect.

### Jeu-du-Pendu
This is a replica of the "Hangman" game if im right, has no interface for now so you need to play it on the console but i may be planning on adding a user interface.

### DOFUS-DISCORD
That one is a api attempt but i failed so for now it is not working at all

**there might be some other repositories if you search but some are just interesting nor finished**
